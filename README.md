# UdeA_TomatoDataset
This dataset contains weekly measurements collected from 135 greenhouse tomato plants under 27 different treatment combinations. The data collection was carried out from November 9, 2023, to April 1, 2024, totaling 20 sessions, each corresponding to one week of measurements. The dataset combines information from a mobile station equipped with IoT sensors, manual measurements, and yield-related variables.

The study was conducted at the Technological Development and Innovation Campus of the University of Antioquia (UdeA), located in the Carmen de Viboral campus. Carmen de Viboral is a municipality in the southeastern region of eastern Antioquia, Colombia, at an altitude of 2,150 meters above sea level and an average temperature of 17 °C.

This dataset enables various analyses of treatment effects and estimation of yield-related variables. The raw dataset is provided in CSV format and includes 2,664 records and 44 variables. A high number of missing or anomalous values were present and were addressed using the method described in Section 4.

A detailed description of the sensors used, measured variables, and data structure can be found in Section 2.

The dataset is shared under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license and is part of the project:
"Development of an intelligent and energy-autonomous agriculture platform for continuous monitoring of relevant variables aimed at improving productivity and mitigating environmental impact in Antioquia and Quindío horticultural crops" (BPIN Code 2022000100012), executed by the University of Antioquia.
