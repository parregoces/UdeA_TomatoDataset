# Mobile and Manual Dataset for Greenhouse Tomato Crop

## Summary
This dataset contains weekly measurements from 135 tomato plants grown in a greenhouse under 27 different treatment combinations. Data were collected between November 9, 2023, and April 1, 2024, using a mobile station with IoT sensors, manual observations, and yield variables.

## Location
The study was conducted at the Technological Development and Innovation Campus of the University of Antioquia (UdeA), located in Carmen de Viboral, Antioquia, Colombia (2,150 meters above sea level, average temperature: 17°C).
